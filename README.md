# 🎨 Draw With Words – A Kid-Friendly Drawing Website

A gentle, interactive web app that helps kids **learn how to draw and color** by simply typing a word.  
Inspired by **MS Paint**, childhood nostalgia, and a school practical at home ❤️

Built for fun, learning, and creativity — no backend, no APIs, no pressure.

## 🌱 Inspiration

This project was inspired by my **little sister’s school practical**, where she had to draw pictures using MS Paint.

The goal was simple:
* Make drawing feel less scary
* Let kids learn by copying
* Keep things fun, not perfect

Sometimes the best project ideas come from real life.
